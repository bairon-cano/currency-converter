# Currency Converter

This is a converter system created with Java. The main converter is the currency converter, since this is a solution to the challenge posed by Alura Latam in the path of Object Oriented Java.

The system also has temperature, time, length and speed converters, as well as a project information button.

In the case of currencies, the value is fixed, so it is not precise with respect to the change they have daily.
